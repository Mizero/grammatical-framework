* Focus on a large coverage Swedish grammar and a robust parser

HÃ¥kan did some preliminary investigations with GF on Talbanken. He tried to parse the treebank directly but the parser failed for almost all sentences because:
    * there are many *missing words* - We need better import of SALDO to GF. I did my own conversion tool but it has bugs and as a result some words are missing (Thanks Dana for finding it!).

    * Swedish Resource Grammar doesn't know anything about *compound words*

    * Not all grammatical constructions are covered

He is not working on this anymore!
