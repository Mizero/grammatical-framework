The idea is to be able to annotate every 'object' in the abstract syntax of a grammar with some extra information. For example we would like to be able to specify the probability of some syntactic construction.

{{{
PredVP {
  printname: "predication";
  prob: 0.5;
  deps: arg head
}

UseV {
  printname: "use verb";
  prob: 0.7;
  deps: head
}

S {
  printname: "Sentence"
}
}}}

{{{
data FunAnnotation
  = FunAnnotation
     { funPrintName :: String
     , funProb      :: Double
     , funDeps      :: [CId]
     }

data CatAnnotation
  = CatAnnotation
     { catPrintName :: String
     }
}}}
